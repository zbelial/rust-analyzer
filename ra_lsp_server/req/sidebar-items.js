Completion items are presented in the IntelliSense user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request ('completionItem/resolve'). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typical use case is for example: the 'textDocument/completion' request doesn’t fill in the documentation property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface then a ‘completionItem/resolve’ request is sent with the selected completion item as a param. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in. The request can delay the computation of the detail and documentation properties.
